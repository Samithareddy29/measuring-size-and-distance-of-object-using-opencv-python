    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project provides a method to calculate the physical size of an object and the distance from the camera to the object using images. It uses OpenCV to process the image and apply geometric principles to perform the measurements. This can be useful in various applications, including robotics, augmented reality, and industrial measurements.\n",

    "Features\n",

    "- Measure the width and height of an object in an image.\n",
    "- Calculate the distance from the camera to the object.\n",
    "- Easy to use and integrate into other projects.\n",

    "Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone the repository:\n",

    "Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare your image: Ensure you have an image with a reference object of known size.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run the script: Use the projectMeasure.py script to measure the size of an object and its distance from the camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - --image: Path to the input image.\n",
    "    - --width: Known width of the reference object in the image (in real-world units).\n"
